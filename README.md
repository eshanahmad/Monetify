# Monetify

Recreates user uploaded images in the style of Claude Monet using neural style transfer with AI generated images from a custom model.

Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 1000 of Claude Monet's paintings to accurately capture and replicate his unique artistic style.

Methodology: Utilized neural style transfer to combine the stylistic elements of Monet's work with user-uploaded photos, creating new images that retain the content of the original photos while adopting Monet's distinct visual characteristics.

Technologies Used: Deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like VGG-19, and image processing libraries.

Outcome: Successfully produced aesthetically pleasing images that merge the content of user-uploaded photos with the style of Claude Monet, demonstrating the capability of AI in creating novel artworks that blend historical art techniques with modern content.
